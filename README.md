## Introduction to Programming - C++ Codes

This repository contains programming assignments, projects, and examples from my **BSc (Hons) in Computer Science** undergraduate degree, specifically from the **Introduction to Programming** course unit. The focus is on basic programming concepts using the **C++ language**.

## Course Overview

The Introduction to Programming course covers fundamental programming principles, including:

- Basic Syntax and Structure in C++
- Variables, Data Types, and Operators
- Control Structures (Loops, Conditional Statements)
- Functions and Recursion
- Arrays and Pointers
- Basic Object-Oriented Programming Concepts
- File Handling

Each file in this repository is an individual exercise or project that demonstrates a specific concept.

## Repository Structure

- **Assignments/**: Contains completed course assignments.
- **Examples/**: Short code snippets for practice.
- **Projects/**: Larger coding projects completed during the course.
  
## Getting Started

To run these programs:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/intro-to-programming-cpp.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the program you want to run and compile using a C++ compiler, such as `g++`:
   ```bash
   g++ filename.cpp -o output
   ./output
   ```

## Prerequisites

Ensure you have a C++ compiler installed. Examples include [g++](https://gcc.gnu.org/) for GCC or [clang++](https://clang.llvm.org/).
